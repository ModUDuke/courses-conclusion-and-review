## Comparing Breakfast Cereals: Outcome Variables

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 362bf33c36
lang: r
xp: 50
skills: 1
```

The food scientists at breakfast cereal manufacturer Puritan Wheat Inc. have developed a new breakfast cereal product called TechnoCrunch. It has a biodegradable nanomaterial coating designed to keep its flakes crispy in milk for longer than the flakes in its competitor cereal, NeoPuffs. Now Puritan Wheat wants to run an experiment to see if the formula works, so it compares the time it takes for TechnoCrunch to get soggy in milk versus the time it takes for NeoPuffs to get soggy. 

In this experiment on the two cereals, which of the following is the outcome variable in Puritan Wheat's analysis?

`@hint`


`@possible_answers`
- The brand of cereal.
- The amount of milk that each flake of cereal can absorb.
- [The time it takes for the cereal to get soggy.]
- Individual flakes.

`@feedback`
- This is the experimental condition that causes the outcome, i.e. the treatment variable, also called the independent variable (because we have the freedom to manipulate its value in an experiment). Try again.
- This is likely correlated with how the dependent variable, but is not mentioned in the prompt. Try again
- Correct! The outcome variable is one's outcome of interest. You will see it also called the dependent variable, because its value depends on the treatment. You might also see the treatment being called the independent variable, because we have the freedom to manipulate its value in an experiment.
- Not quite. Try again.

- Look at the graphs to the right of the page. Are you sure they look identical?
- Yes. This is why statisticians have created so many different types of summary statistics, and why we encourage understanding so many of them.
- Not necessarily. The distributions certainly appear different to the eye, and so perhaps different dynamics are at work in each graph. Try again.
- Unless the webserver just broke, the correlation function is working perfectly, and it is not the reason these graphs seem different. Try again.

## Baseball Ad Campaign: Early Success?

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 0ecec920ef
lang: r
xp: 50

```

Let’s see what happened in the first month of the ad campaign for our individual fan. Take a look at the following table:

| Month    |Attended|Ads Served|
|----------|-------:|---------:|
| April    |   0    |    0     |
| May      |   1    |    0     |
| June     |   2    |    0     |
| July     |   7    |    5     |
| August   |   -    |    -     |
| September|   -    |    -     |

Since the number of baseball games that this individual went to appears to increase after viewing 5 ads, can we conclude that the advertising campaign caused the individual to go to more games?

`@hint`


`@possible_answers`
- Yes, the treatment had a positive effect on the outcome variable.
- No, the treatment had no effect.
- [It's too early to tell.]

`@feedback`
- Almost, but remember, the main reason we worry about confounders has to do with effects on the outcome, not on treatment assignment. Try again.
- Correct! Confounders are called *confounders* for a reason---because when they are present, we cannot distinguish the effect of treatment from the effect of the confounder. To learn causal effects, we want to compare people with treatment and people without treatment. If those two groups of people differ in their values of some potential confounding variable, then we can't tell if differences in outcomes are due to differences in treatment, or differences in the confounder.
- Unobserved variables are not always a problem in causal inference, because they may not have any effect on outomes. Try again.

## Unhappiness at Unter: Identifying Heterogeneous Outcomes - ATE

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 311670fb1a
lang: r
xp: 100
skills: 1
```

The transportation network company, Unter Technologies, is interested in improving their employee morale and reducing employee turnover rate by downsizing their Human Resources (HR) Department.

To make sure this would not antagonize their workforce, Unter conducts an experiment: With a balanced sample of employees, Unter tells a treatment group that the HR Department will be downsized in the following year, and a control group that the HR Department will remain the same size in the following year (and magically, they don't end up discussing this with each other). Unter then surveys the employees to find out whether employees plan to look for new jobs, with response options 0="No" and 1="Yes."

With the dataframe, `UnterHR`, determine whether there is a negative or positive average treatment effect of reducing the size of Unter's HR department on employee turnover:

`@instructions`
- 1) Determine the average effect of reducing the size of HR (`treatment`) on whether employees plan to leave their job in the following year (`LeaveJob`).

`@hint`
- Try breaking the task into pieces. First find the mean rate of `LeaveJob`in the control condition (`Treatment==0`) then find the mean rate of `LeaveJob`in the treatment condition (`Treatment==1`).

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
library(dplyr)
set.seed(1)
n=382
#Dataframe
  UnterHR<-data.frame(Treatment=rbinom(n,1,.4),Female=rbinom(n,1,.1),LeaveJob=0)
#LeaveJob
  #treatment makes men less likely to leave
    UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==0]<-rbinom(length(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==0]),1,.3)
    UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==0]<-rbinom(length(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==0]),1,.2)
  #treatment makes wommen more likely to leave
    UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==1]<-rbinom(length(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==1]),1,.3)
    UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==1]<-rbinom(length(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==1]),1,.6)
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# Note 1: The average treatment effect is simply the mean outcome of the treatment group minus the mean outcome of the control group. The mean outcome overall is calculated below:

    mean(UnterHR$LeaveJob)

# Note 2: You will need to `subset` the data into treatment and control groups. For example, we create a data frame for just those in the treatment group below:

    dfTreated<-UnterHR[UnterHR$Treatment==1,]

# 1) Write the code that finds the average effect of reducing the size of HR (`treatment`) on whether employees plan to leave their job in the following year (`LeaveJob`). Assign this value to Solution1.

    Solution1<-
    
```

`@solution`
```{r}
Solution1<- mean(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1])-mean(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0])
```

`@sct`
```{r}
test_object("Solution1")
success_msg("Good work! It seems that reducing the size of HR reduced Unter employees' intentions to leave their jobs")

Since reducing the size of HR seems to reduce the rate of employee turnover, the CEO of Unter Technologies is now heavily considering this option.

However, his chief operating officer (COO) warns him that reducing the size of HR might be unpopular among certain minority groups within the company, particularly among women. The COO sends the CEO a figure (illustrated in the R workspace) showing the results of his experiment among men and women. Which of the following does the figure suggest?

`@possible_answers`
- While the pooled average treatment effect is slightly negative, and the average treatment effect for men is negative, the average treatment effect for women is positive.
- While the pooled average treatment effect is slightly positive, and the average treatment effect for men is positive, the average treatment effect for women is negative.
- While the pooled average treatment effect is slightly negative, and the average treatment effect for men is positive, the average treatment effect for women is negative.
- While the pooled average treatment effect is slightly positive, and the average treatment effect for men is negative, the average treatment effect for women is positive.

## Unhappiness at Unter: Identifying Heterogeneous Outcomes - CATEs (2)

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: a4ab5d9f9b
lang: r

```

Let's further analyze the heterogeneous effect of the treatment on men vs. women in Unter Technologies. With the dataframe, `UnterHR`, determine the average treatment effect of reducing the size of Unter's HR department on employee turnover by gender (`Female`).

`@instructions`
- 1) Determine the average effect of reducing the size of HR (`treatment`) on whether male employees (`Female = 0`) plan to leave the job in the following year (`LeaveJob`).
- 2) Determine the average effect of reducing the size of HR (`treatment`) on whether female employees (`Female = 1`) plan to leave the job in the following year (`LeaveJob`).

`@hint`
- Remember, you can determine the ATE by subtracting the mean rate of the outcome in the control condition by the mean rate of the outcome in the treatment condition.
- You will need to use the `mean` and `subset` commands.
- Try breaking the task into pieces. First find the mean rate of `LeaveJob`in the control condition (`Treatment=0`) then find the mean rate of `LeaveJob`in the treatment condition (`Treatment=1`).

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
library(dplyr)
set.seed(1)
n=382
#Dataframe
  UnterHR<-data.frame(Treatment=rbinom(n,1,.4),Female=rbinom(n,1,.1),LeaveJob=0)
#LeaveJob
  #treatment makes men less likely to leave
    UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==0]<-rbinom(length(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==0]),1,.3)
    UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==0]<-rbinom(length(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==0]),1,.2)
  #treatment makes wommen more likely to leave
    UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==1]<-rbinom(length(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==1]),1,.3)
    UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==1]<-rbinom(length(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==1]),1,.6)
```

`@sample_code`
```{r}
# Note: Since we are interested in understanding the rates of intention to leave by treatment and gender, we might want to examine a three way table of this relationship first. The following syntax prints the numbers of men and women who intend to leave work by treatment group and gender:

    xtabs(~LeaveJob+Treatment+Female, data=UnterHR)

# Note: This question is tricky because we want to subset the data based on two condition (i.e. whether someone is treated and whether someone is female). Below is an example of how to get the mean rate of leaving a job for men who were treated. The `&` symbol is used to add an additional condition:

    mean(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==0])

# 1) Write the code that determines the average treatment effect among men. Assign this value to Solution1.

    Solution1<- 

# 2) Write the code that determines the average treatment effect among women. Assign this value to Solution2.

    Solution2<-
```

`@solution`
```{r}
Solution1 <- mean(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==0])-mean(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==0])
Solution2 <- mean(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==1 & UnterHR$Female==1])-mean(UnterHR$LeaveJob[UnterHR$Treatment==0 & UnterHR$Female==1])
```

`@sct`
