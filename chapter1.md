The food scientists at breakfast cereal manufacturer Puritan Wheat Inc. have developed a new breakfast cereal product called TechnoCrunch. It has a biodegradable nanomaterial coating designed to keep its flakes crispy in milk for longer than the flakes in its competitor cereal, NeoPuffs. Now Puritan Wheat wants to run an experiment to see if the formula works, so it compares the time it takes for TechnoCrunch to get soggy in milk versus the time it takes for NeoPuffs to get soggy. 

In this experiment on the two cereals, which of the following is the outcome variable in Puritan Wheat's analysis?

`@hint`


`@possible_answers`
- The brand of cereal.
- The amount of milk that each flake of cereal can absorb.
- The time it takes for the cereal to get soggy.
- Individual flakes.
